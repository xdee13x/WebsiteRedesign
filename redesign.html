      <p>After operating for 15 years in a rented space on Mission Boulevard, we moved at the end of 2003 to the present location in the Dollar Drive Business Park in Hayward.</p>

      <p>This new location, in a business park not far from city center, is ideal for the retail-manufacturing nature of our business. This 5,000 sq.ft. building has enough space for future growth. We are especially happy with the new location because our customers won't have parking problems any more.</p>

      <p>We believe in doing the lettering in-house as much as possible in order to maintain high product quality and meet customers' deadlines. To this end, we have continuously built up our equipment for engraving, embroidery, printing, heat-press and etching. Recently, we added a sand-blasting system to etch on glass and crystal items. We will keep improving our facilities to ensure our product quality and service.</p>

      <p>Acme Awards is owned and run by Sue and Jin Lee. Sue has a degree in Garments and Textiles and has extensive knowledge in embroidery and apparel. Jin has an advanced degree in Business Administration and has been doing the engraving and award making since 1988.</p>

      <p>Our dedication to high product quality and customer service has rewarded us with loyal, high-quality clientele. We list some major customers below in appreciation of their patronage over the years.</p>
